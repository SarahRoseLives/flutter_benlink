flutter_benlink
===============

A Dart port of the excellent Python library [benlink](https://github.com/khusmann/benlink) by Kyle Husmann, designed for controlling Benshi-protocol radios (like the BTech GMRS-PRO) from a Flutter application.

This library provides the low-level protocol implementation and a high-level `RadioController` to make it easy to interact with your radio over Bluetooth. The primary goal is to empower developers to create custom, open-source mobile applications for their hardware.

This project is a work in progress, with the ultimate goal of supporting the full feature set of the original `benlink` library.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is an independent effort and is **not** affiliated with or endorsed by Benshi, BTech, Vero, or any other radio manufacturer. The protocol has been reverse-engineered. Use this library at your own risk. The authors are **not** responsible for any damage caused to your radio or other equipment.

üéØ Current Focus: Android + Bluetooth Classic
---------------------------------------------

The initial version of this library is focused on providing core functionality for **Android apps** using **Bluetooth Classic (RFCOMM)**.

* * * * *

‚úÖ Supported Features
--------------------

This library already supports the core, non-audio features of the radio protocol:

-   **Connection Management**: Connects to the radio via `flutter_bluetooth_serial`.

-   **High-Level Controller**: An easy-to-use `RadioController` that manages state using `ChangeNotifier`, making it simple to integrate with your Flutter UI.

-   **Device Info**: Read the radio's model, vendor, version, and supported features.

-   **Radio Settings**: Read and write the main settings block of the radio.

-   **Channel Management**:

    -   Read and write individual channel configurations (frequency, name, tones, etc.).

    -   Fetch a list of all channels from the radio.

-   **Real-time Status**:

    -   Get live status updates (Power, TX/RX state, Scan state, GPS lock, etc.).

    -   Subscribe to events for changes in status, settings, and the current channel.

-   **Power & GPS**:

    -   Read the current battery voltage and percentage.

    -   Fetch the last known GPS position from the device.

-   **VFO Control**: Read the VFO channel and set its frequency.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap to Full `benlink` Compatibility
-------------------------------------------

The goal is to implement the entire feature set of the original Python library. Pull requests are welcome!

-   [ ] **Audio Streaming**: Implement real-time audio capture (TX) and playback (RX) over the audio RFCOMM channel. This is the highest priority feature.

-   [ ] **TNC / Packet Support**: Add support for sending and receiving APRS/BSS data packets and managing `BeaconSettings`.

-   [ ] **BLE Support**: Add a `BleCommandLink` to allow connections over Bluetooth Low Energy, in addition to the current RFCOMM link.

-   [ ] **Expanded Command Set**: Implement the remaining commands from the protocol (e.g., programmable function buttons, advanced settings, etc.).

-   [ ] **Firmware Flashing**: As a long-term goal, investigate and implement the firmware update process.

üì¶ Installation
---------------

This package is not yet on `pub.dev`. To use it in your project, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as a git dependency:

    dependencies:
      flutter_benlink:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/SarahRoseLives/flutter_benlink.git
          ref: main 

Then, run flutter pub get in your terminal.

# üöÄ Quick Start

Ensure you have flutter_bluetooth_serial set up in your Android project.

Use ChangeNotifierProvider (from the provider package) to make the RadioController available to your widget tree.
